# TAINT
Welcome to TAINT – Your malware's favorite sandbox and the ultimate red teamer’s tool for testing, analyzing, and evading detection in the crypto space. Specifically designed for malware development/detection procedures and payload testing, TAINT integrates AI capabilities with crypto analysis tools to create an intelligent, automated testing environment like no other.

This web application empowers red teamers and cybersecurity experts to validate malware evasion techniques, assess detection signatures, and simulate crypto-focused attack behaviors before deployment in the field. Think of it as your personal box for perfecting your tradecraft, while staying undetected by production security systems and blockchain defenses.

## Crypto-Specific Analysis & Blockchain Monitoring:
Cryptocurrency Address Monitoring: AI continuously tracks blockchain transactions across Ethereum, Solana, and other popular networks to identify suspicious wallet interactions, laundering attempts, or ransomware payments.
Transaction Pattern Detection: Predicts unusual transaction activities such as wallet draining, cross-chain transfers, or token laundering activities.
## Smart Contract Behavior: 
AI analyzes interactions with smart contracts on Ethereum and Solana, detecting potentially malicious contract calls or exploits.
Cross-Chain Attack Simulation: The platform simulates attacks that involve bridging assets between blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, monitoring crypto addresses for fraud, and detecting malware attempting to exfiltrate funds.

## AI-Enhanced Analysis Capabilities:
Static Analysis Engine:
Signature-based detection using industry-standard rulesets.
AI-assisted binary entropy analysis to detect unusual encryption patterns.
String extraction, pattern matching, and anomaly detection to identify hidden indicators of malicious behavior.
Dynamic Analysis Engine: Available in two modes:
File Analysis Mode
Process ID (PID) Analysis Mode Features include:
AI-powered behavioral monitoring to track file and process interactions with the blockchain.
Memory region inspection to uncover malicious memory behavior.
Process hollowing & injection technique detection to identify evasion tactics.
AI-driven sleep pattern monitoring to track delays or “sleeping” malware.
